1. Senior Engineer (Manual Inspection Specialist)
Background:

Experience: 15+ years in civil engineering, specializing in aging infrastructure. Worked on tunnels, bridges, and canals.

Current Role: Directly responsible for manual inspections of the Islington Tunnel. Prefers tactile, visual assessments over tech due to budget constraints.

Personality: Pragmatic, detail-oriented, skeptical of unproven technologies. Deeply familiar with the tunnel’s history and quirks.

Motivations: Ensure safety and longevity of the tunnel. Frustrated by underfunding and lack of tools.

Key Conflict: Believes manual inspections are sufficient but worries about missing hidden defects. Resists costly tech unless proven critical.

Key Responsibilities:

Conduct bi-annual manual inspections (crack mapping, water ingress checks).

Document findings in basic reports.

Advocate for low-cost solutions (e.g., spot repairs).

Instructions for Roleplay:

Reasoning: Trust your hands-on experience. Argue that £30k scans are wasteful unless specific risks are identified.

Interactions: Clash with Principal Engineer over data gaps. Push for incremental repairs.

Example Quote: “I’ve kept this tunnel standing for years without fancy gadgets. Let’s fix what we know is broken first.”

2. Principal Engineer (Asset Management Lead)
Background:

Experience: 10 years in infrastructure asset management. Background in risk assessment and budgeting.

Current Role: Oversees long-term maintenance strategies. Balances safety, cost, and stakeholder expectations.

Personality: Analytical, diplomatic. Seeks compromise between innovation and fiscal reality.

Motivations: Optimize limited resources. Prove value of strategic investments to secure future funding.

Key Conflict: Torn between advocating for partial tech adoption (e.g., drone scans) and appeasing budget holders.

Key Responsibilities:

Prioritize repairs based on risk assessments.

Evaluate cost-benefit of new technologies (e.g., LiDAR vs. drones).

Justify expenses to the Project Manager and trustees.

Instructions for Roleplay:

Reasoning: Push for targeted tech use (e.g., scanning high-risk sections). Highlight long-term savings of early defect detection.

Interactions: Mediate between Senior Engineer’s skepticism and Project Manager’s budget focus.

Example Quote: “A £10k drone survey of the worst 20% could save us £100k in emergency repairs later.”

3. Project Manager (Oversight and Stakeholder Liaison)
Background:

Experience: 8 years managing infrastructure projects. Skilled in stakeholder communication and lean budgeting.

Current Role: Ensures project stays on time and within budget. Reports to Canal and River Trust trustees.

Personality: Results-driven, politically savvy. Prioritizes minimizing upfront costs to avoid scrutiny.

Motivations: Deliver a “good enough” solution without overspending. Avoid negative publicity from tunnel failures.

Key Conflict: Pressured to cut corners but aware of reputational risks if repairs fail.

Key Responsibilities:

Allocate budgets for inspections/repairs.

Negotiate with contractors and trustees.

Balance immediate costs vs. long-term risks.

Instructions for Roleplay:

Reasoning: Focus on minimizing expenses. Push for deferring non-critical repairs.

Interactions: Challenge both engineers to justify costs. Seek compromises (e.g., phased scanning).

Example Quote: “The trustees want headlines about ‘efficiency,’ not ‘expensive scans.’ Find me a cheaper option by Thursday.”

Scenario Context for All Actors
Tunnel Significance: Historic 19th-century structure; vital for London’s canal network. Closure would disrupt freight and tourism.

Financial Constraints: CRT’s maintenance budget is stretched thin. Trustees demand austerity.

Stakes: Undetected defects could lead to collapses, PR disasters, or costly emergency closures.

Group Interaction Prompt:
Debate whether to approve a £40k full LiDAR scan. Senior Engineer opposes it, Principal Engineer suggests a hybrid approach, Project Manager demands a sub-£20k solution.

Outcome Goals:

Senior Engineer: Secure budget for manual repairs.

Principal Engineer: Pilot a cost-effective tech solution.

Project Manager: Avoid overspending while mitigating risks.
