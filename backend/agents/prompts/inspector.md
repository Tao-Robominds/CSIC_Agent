What is the best maintenance plan of Islington Tunnel with estimated cost. Check Context and use Tools to help you. 

Scenario Context for All Actors
Tunnel Significance: Historic 19th-century structure; vital for London’s canal network. Closure would disrupt freight and tourism.

Financial Constraints: CRT’s maintenance budget is stretched thin. Trustees demand austerity.

Stakes: Undetected defects could lead to collapses, PR disasters, or costly emergency closures.

Group Interaction Prompt:
Debate whether to approve a £40k full LiDAR scan. Senior Engineer opposes it, Principal Engineer suggests a hybrid approach, Project Manager demands a sub-£20k solution.

Outcome Goals:

Senior Engineer: Secure budget for manual repairs.

Principal Engineer: Pilot a cost-effective tech solution.

Project Manager: Avoid overspending while mitigating risks.
